    summary: 
    Sometimes going on a trip with my friends to explore Bandung and its surroundings, 
    on that trip we always hunt a good new spot for photos and also try all kind of food. Because I loved to eat I also like to cook,
    because it is fun and challenging. And usually I spend my free time to watching movies or listening to pop/rock music,
